Why full user fee (toll) is to be paid although we travel a small length on the project road?
<br>
In India, the tolling is generally under the open system, whereby fee payable is a fixed amount based on the length of stretch under one project which is normally 60 kilometers. If a stretch is of lesser length, user fee of actual length only is collected.

<div>
<li><a target="_blank"><font color="#FFFF00">
Why the user fee (toll) rate is different at 2 Toll Plazas?
<br>
User fee on a particular fee plaza is based on stretch length under that plaza, structures (bridge, tunnel, bypass) and width of the highways, applicable fee rules and provisions of the concessions agreement.

The categories of vehicles and their rates are different?
<br>                                                       
Vehicles are categorised for the welfare of road users. This categorisation is primarily based on the size and load they carry and damage done to the road and type of use (commercial/personnel) of a vehicle.

<li><a target="_blank"><font color="#FFFF00">
Why concessions to local/ frequent users are different?
<br>
Concession to local/frequent users are extended as welfare measures. There may be variation in the concessions available as these have been provided at different times under different fee rules and provisions of concession agreement.

Why the formula and the date of annual revision of user fee across the toll plazas are different? Why rounding of fee in some toll plazas is Re.1/- and Rs.5/- in others?
<br>
Annual revision is done w.e.f. 1st April and fee is to be rounded off to the nearest Rs 5 as per the new user fee rules. However some roads built before 2008 are governed by old ruleswhere fee is rounded off to Re 1 only.

User fee collection started even though the project is not completed.
 <br>                                                       
User fee is levied and collected as per applicable fee rules and provisions of the concession agreement. In some cases, user fee collection is allowed when project is 75% complete. This helps people to use the completed part of the road and traveller pays only for the 75% length opened for traffic.

The Concessionaire has collected user fee (toll) more than the expenditure incurred by him. Why he is allowed to continue with toll collection?
<br>
User fee is levied and collected as per applicable fee rules and provisions of the concession agreement. As per rule, a concessionnaire has right to collect user fee till the completion of concession period allowed under the agreement.

How long a toll plaza shall be in operation? What is the duration for which the user fee shall be collected at any toll plaza?
<br>                                                     
Once a highway is built, Fee is to be collected to recover the cost. Once cost is recovered the fee is collected at reduced rate of 40% as the road is to be maintained in good condition for the travellers.

The list of exempted vehicles is not uniform in the projects.
<br>
List of exempted vehicles is different as exemptions have been granted under different rules prevailing at the time of construction of the road.
